## Abstract
The Northwest Atlantic ocean We applied a spatio-temporal model that includes annual, seasonal, and spatial variation in density to standardize spatially and temporally unbalanced sampling. Northwest Atlantic Ocean from 1994-2017 . 


## Introduction


* Zooplankton are critical links within marine foodwebs
* Northeast Continental Shelf LME (NEUS) 


## Methods

We compiled sampling data from the EcoMon program (Kane, 2007). We selected taxa that had at least 10% positive tows and
